				<h4>Getting Started: Running Seltzer</h4>
				Running Seltzer is very simple. There are 4 things you need:
				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>Seltzer Core</li>
					<li>A 1.7+ Java installation</li>
					<li>A Google Chrome installation</li>
					<li>
						The Chrome web driver 
						(<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/">here</a>)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					To prepare, make your Seltzer directory. It's recommended it be somewhere easy 
					to get to with your shell/command line. Take your copy of Seltzer Core, 
					probably named something like 
					<code>seltzer-core-x.y.z-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code>, where x.y.z 
					represents the version you've downloaded/compiled. For brevity, the rest of 
					this document will call it seltzer-core.jar.Also, make a subfolder called 
					<code>web_drivers</code> and put your Chrome web driver in there.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to actually start Seltzer, navigate a shell/command prompt to your 
					Seltzer directory. Then you simply run it with the command 
					<code>java -jar seltzer-core.jar -Dseltzer.path=/absolute/path/to/seltzer/dir</code>. 
					The <code>seltzer.path</code> property that is set in the command is 
					absolutely required (unless you set it in your config file), and it must be an 
					absolute path. This is the directory that Seltzer will place the new browser 
					profiles in, as well as look for the web driver.
