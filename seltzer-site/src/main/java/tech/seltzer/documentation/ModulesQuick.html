				<h4>Getting Started: Using Seltzer</h4>
				<p>
					Using Seltzer is almost as easy as running it, but not quite. At the bare 
					minimum, you must include <code>seltzer-cr</code> in your classpath (we 
					recommend using Apache Maven to manage dependencies). Is is strongly encouraged 
					that <code>seltzer-util</code> be included as well. For those sourcing their 
					dependencies directly from Maven, here is the information you need:
					<ul class="browser-default">
						<li>Group ID (for both): <code>tech.seltzer</code></li>
						<li>CR artifact ID: <code>seltzer-cr</code></li>
						<li>Util artifact ID: <code>seltzer-util</code></li>
					</ul>
					These modules will have a version number matching that of 
					<code>seltzer-core</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Include those 2 modules and you're ready to start developing using Seltzer. 
					Working with Seltzer requires that you send it command data, and it will shoot 
					back a response object. Command data gets encoded into JSON before it's sent 
					to a Seltzer server (we recommend Gson, which the util module uses).
				</p>
				<p>
					To begin, a <span style="font-weight:bold">Seltzer session</span> must be 
					started. To do so, you must send a Start command to Seltzer. The simplest way 
					to do this is to call this:
					<br/>
					<code>SeltzerSend.send(new CommandData(CommandType.START))</code>
					<br/>
					Note: it will be assumed that you are using seltzer-util for communication. 
					See <a href="#noUtil">"Using Seltzer Without seltzer-util"</a> for help 
					writing your own solution or debugging another. The <code>send()</code> method 
					returns a <code>Response</code> object. When starting a session, this object 
					will have 2 pieces of relevant data: a success flag and an ID. This ID will be 
					required for all communication with this Seltzer session. Other than start 
					commands, Seltzer ignores commands that do not have an ID for a currently 
					existing session.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now that you have your ID, you can begin sending more substantial commands. 
					To get an idea of what Seltzer is capable of handling, see the 
					<code>CommandType</code> enum. This lists all the commands that Seltzer 
					handles, as well as containing the <code>CommandData</code> class that those 
					commands will require. Some commands are very specific and will be simple to 
					instantiate. Take <code>FillFieldCommandData</code> for example. This is a 
					non-generic command date class, so you're not allowed to set the command type 
					on it. It knows its job. What it requires from you is a selector type (xpath, 
					ID, class...see <code>SelectorType</code> for the list), the data for the 
					selector (like the xpath expression), and what you want to put into that form 
					field. Of course, it needs your session ID, as well. All commands do. Once you 
					give it that info, Seltzer can handle the rest.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for the less-specific ones, like the generic parent 
					<code>CommandData</code>, You have to provide the command type that you want 
					it to be. If you don't have the right command type assigned to the command 
					you're building (like building a <code>CommandData</code> and calling it a 
					<code>SelectorCommand</code>), Seltzer will spit an exception back at you. 
					If in doubt, consult the <code>CommandType</code> enum. That list is always 
					correct. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When you're done with your session, you need to tell Seltzer to exit. To do so. 
					build a <code>CommandData</code> object, give it your session ID, and set the 
					command type to <code>CommandType.EXIT</code>. Seltzer will close the browser 
					window, clean up any residual data, and forget your session ID. That session 
					ID will no longer be acknowledged and no data can be retrieved from it, so 
					make sure you get what you need before you close it.
				</p>
				<h4 id="noUtil">Using Seltzer Without seltzer-util</h4>
				<p>
					There are a couple of "gotchas" to watch out for if you roll your own code for 
					sending and receiving. Following the guidelines below should keep you 
					productive and bug-free.
					<h5>Sending</h5>
					<ul class="browser-default">
						<li>
							If your command is an instance of <code>SerializableCR</code>, make 
							sure you call its <code>serialize()</code> method to make sure all the 
							commands under it will make the encoding to JSON appropriately. This 
							is a recursive method, so it will handle any 
							<code>SerializableCR</code> objects that it contains. Do this before 
							serializing the command you're handling!
						</li>
						<li>
							Be sure to reference the class that your command type is holding on to 
							when you serialize to JSON.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>Receiving</h5>
					<ul class="browser-default">
						<li>
							Responses need to be decoded from JSON twice. The first time, they 
							need to be decoded as basic <code>Response</code> objects. Use this to 
							get the real <code>ResponseType</code> from it. The second time, use 
							the <code>ResponseType</code> you got so that you can get the right 
							data out of that JSON string. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Commands that caused exceptions will have 
							<code>ExceptionResponse</code> objects returned. These have a response 
							type of EXCEPTION. They also contain a message and (if appropriate) a 
							stack trace from the Seltzer server. Use this information to throw a 
							<code>SeltzerException</code>, which is in the CR module. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Similar to handling a <code>SerializableCR</code> command, you need to 
							handle them in responses. In this instance, call the 
							<code>deserialize()</code> method and all the responses will be built 
							back up properly. This is recursive, just like 
							<code>serialize()</code>. Make sure this is the last thing you do 
							while handling responses.
						</li>
					</ul>
